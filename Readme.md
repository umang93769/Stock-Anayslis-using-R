Our Software Project is about Stock Price Prediction using Time Series Analysis. It come
under Machine Learning Concept using R Language. We have inculcated Shiny Package for
the GUI and have implemented using RStudio for hosting and for doing the analysis on the
project.
Here we have used two ARIMA models for forecasting that is Seasonal and Non Seasonal at
80% and 95% confidence level.
Also we have created a Executive dashboard with certain features like To-Do List, Alerts,
And Progress.

Screenshots of the working and the result are as below.
